Open Source Veterinary Clinic Management Software

This software will allow the creation of customers, pets, visits, inventory, procedures, and
invoicing. Other features are planned.

DO NOT UNCOMPRESS THIS FILE DIRECTLY INTO THE ROOT DIRECTORY.
When you uncompress this file make sure you use the directory structure included. The directory
vetclinic should end up being created in the root directory. This will prevent files in the root
directory from being overwritten. It will also put the proper directory structure for the system in
place.

Be sure to read the User Manual for installation and post installation instrcutions.

I would like to acknowledge and thank the Open Source Projects that are integrated into VetClinic.
